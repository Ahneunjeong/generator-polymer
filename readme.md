## Introduction

[Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) is a library of polyfills and sugar which enable the use of Web Components in modern browsers. The project allows developers to build apps using the platform of tomorrow and inform the W3C of places where in-flight specifications can be further improved.

`generator-polymer` provides Polymer scaffolding using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (a scaffolding tool for the web), letting you easily create and customize Polymer (custom) elements via the command-line and import them using HTML Imports. This saves you time writing boilerplate code so you can start writing up the logic to your components straight away.

## Features

* Boilerplate to create reusable Polymer elements
* Quick deploy to GitHub pages
* All the goodness of `seed-element` (docs & landing page for your element)

## Installation

Install the generator
`npm install -g generator-polymer`

Make a new directory and cd into it
`mkdir my-new-project && cd $_`

Scaffold a new Polymer element:
`yo polymer`

Deploy a shareable version of your element to GitHub pages:
`yo polymer:gh`
